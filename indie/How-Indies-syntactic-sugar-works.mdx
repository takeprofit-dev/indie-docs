Indie programming language has several [_syntactic sugar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) constructs
which simplify a lot writing code of technical analysis indicators for TakeProfit platform.

# `Main` entry point

Every indicator in Indie has a `Main` entry point. It could be written in one of two forms: as a `Main` _function
definition_ which is a form of syntactic sugar or as a `Main` _class definition_ (which is not).

## `Main` function definition

Here is an example of minimal indicator written in a form of a `Main` as a function definition:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator

@indicator('Example')
def Main(self):
    return self.close[0]
```

This form is very compact therefore it is recommended for simple indicators.

When Indie compiler sees a combination of a function definition with name `Main` decorated with `@indicator` it transforms it into a `Main` class definition (i.e. to the second form) according to a few simple rules:

- function definition is replaced with a `Main` class definition which is inherited from `indie.MainContext` base class;
- the body of `Main` function becomes `Main.calc()` method;
- `Main` class may optionally have `__init__` constructor (only if it is needed).

This transformation is automatic and hidden from user, that is why the first form of `Main` entry point is considered to
be a syntactic sugar. In some cases when indicator needs greater control over what is happening in the code the second form of writing the indicator's `Main` entry point with classes syntax can be used explicitly.

## `Main` written as a class definition

Indicator could be written using the second form of a `Main` entry point which uses class definition syntax:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator, MainContext

@indicator('Example')
class Main(MainContext):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def calc(self):
        return self.close[0]
```

Writing indicator in the second form using class syntax is less compact but it has it's advantages, for example user is
able to declare `__init__` constructor method and place some one-time initialization code there. Therefore for
indicators with complex logic you probably would like to use the second form. Constructor `__init__` is optional though.

# Functions decorated with `@algorithm`

Functions decorated with `@algorithm` are automatically transformed by Indie compiler into classes inherited from
`indie.Algorithm`. For example:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import algorithm, SeriesF
from indie.algorithms import Ema

@algorithm
def DoubleEma(self, src: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
    ema1 = Ema.new(src, length)
    ema2 = Ema.new(ema1, length)
    return ema2
```

Will be transformed into a class form:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import Algorithm, SeriesF, Context
from indie.algorithms import Ema

class DoubleEma(Algorithm):
    def __init__(self, ctx: Context):
        super().__init__(ctx)

    def calc(self, src: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
        ema1 = Ema.new(src, length)
        ema2 = Ema.new(ema1, length)
        return ema2
```

Users are able to choose which form they want to use in their indicators' code. Of course, as with `Main` entry point,
the decorator-based form is preferred in most cases. Class form should be used only in more complex cases, where a
more fine-grained control is needed.

Decorator `@algorithm` is also a syntactic sugar in Indie language. Here are the simple rules that Indie compiler uses
to process it:

- function definition decorated with `@algorithm` is replaced with a class with the same name inherited from
  `indie.Algorithm` base class;
- original function becomes a `calc` method of this class, function body does not change;
- `__init__` constructor is added to the generated class which accepts `ctx: indie.Context` parameter and forwards it to
  the parent constructor;

NOTE: to get OHLCV values of the current instrument from the algorithm methods there is a `self.ctx` property of
`indie.Context` type. For example to get access to close prices use `self.ctx.close` expression.

The `DoubleEma` algorithm from the example above could be created and used in two ways:

- Using `DoubleEma.new()` static method (`new` is a method of parent class `indie.Algorithm`, well... not exactly but
  kind of). This is a syntactic sugar that allows to use any algorithm right in the place where it is needed in the
  indicator (e.g. in `def Main` function, or in the function body of some other algorithm).
- Using `DoubleEma()` constructor in `__init__` method of a corresponding `MainContext`, `SecContext` or other
  `Algorithm`. Then, in the `calc` method of a corresponding `MainContext`, `SecContext` or other
  `Algorithm` you should explicitly call the `DoubleEma`'s `calc()` method.

# `Algorithm.new()` method

Method `Algorithm.new()` is used to create and use algorithm objects in Indie. It looks like a static method, but
it behaves very differently because it is also a syntactic sugar of the language. When Indie compiler sees a call, e.g.
`res = Ema.new(src, length)`, it uses the following rules to transform such a piece of code:

- a class field is created in corresponding `__init__` constructor of the enclosing `MainContext`, `SecContext` or other
  `Algorithm`. In our example it would be: `self._ema1 = Ema(ctx)` (in case `self` is a `Context`) or
  `self._ema1 = Ema(self.ctx)` (in case `self` is an `Algorithm`).
- the call of `Ema.new` is replaced with `self._ema1.calc` call. In our example it would be
  `res = self._ema1.calc(src, length)`.

Here is a full example of such transformation:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import Algorithm, SeriesF, Context
from indie.algorithms import Ema

class DoubleEma(Algorithm):
    def __init__(self, ctx: Context):
        super().__init__(ctx)

    def calc(self, src: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
        ema1 = Ema.new(src, length)
        ema2 = Ema.new(ema1, length)
        return ema2
```

Will be transformed into:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import Algorithm, SeriesF, Context
from indie.algorithms import Ema

class DoubleEma(Algorithm):
    def __init__(self, ctx: Context):
        super().__init__(ctx)
        self._ema1 = Ema(self.ctx)
        self._ema2 = Ema(self.ctx)

    def calc(self, src: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
        ema1 = self._ema1.calc(src, length)
        ema2 = self._ema2.calc(ema1, length)
        return ema2
```

Of course, syntactic sugar of `Algorithm.new()` works only inside methods of descendants of `MainContext`, `SecContext`
or other `Algorithm` classes (except the `__init__` constructors). You cannot use this functionality in plain
Python-like functions.

Syntactic sugar of `Algorithm.new()` method can be used with any Indie algorithm regardless of the form in which the
algorithm was written (the decorator-based form or the class-based form).

# `MutSeries[T].new()` method

Method `MutSeries[T].new()` (or `MutSeriesF.new()` where `MutSeriesF` is an alias for `MutSeries[float]`) is used to create and use mutable series objects in Indie. It looks like a static method, but
it behaves very differently because it is also a syntactic sugar of the language. When Indie compiler sees a call, e.g.
`s = MutSeriesF.new((a + b) / 2)`, it uses the following rules to transform such a piece of code:

- a class field is created in corresponding `__init__` constructor of the enclosing `MainContext`, `SecContext` or
  `Algorithm`. In our example it would be: `self._ms1 = self.new_mut_series_f()` (in case `self` is a `Context`) or `self.ctx.new_mut_series_f()` (in case `self` is an `Algorithm`).
- the call of `MutSeriesF.new` is replaced with `self._ms1.calc` call. In our example it would be
  `s = self._ms1.calc((a + b) / 2)`. Method `MutSeriesF.calc` writes given expression `(a  + b) / 2` into the last
  element of the mutable series object and returns a reference to the mutable series itself.

For example:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import algorithm, SeriesF, MutSeriesF

@algorithm
def Hl2(self) -> SeriesF:
    h = self.ctx.high
    l = self.ctx.low
    return MutSeriesF.new((h[0] + l[0]) / 2)
```

transforms into:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import Algorithm, SeriesF, MutSeriesF, Context

class Hl2(Algorithm):
    def __init__(self, ctx: Context):
        super().__init__(ctx)
        self._ms1 = self.ctx.new_mut_series_f()

    def calc(self) -> SeriesF:
        h = self.ctx.high
        l = self.ctx.low
        return self._ms1.calc((h[0] + l[0]) / 2)
```

In this example two transformations took place at once: syntactic sugar of `@algorithm` and `MutSeriesF.new()` call.

# Functions decorated with `@sec_context`

Functions decorated with `@sec_context` are used to create secondary entry-points (besides `Main`) which are needed when
indicator requests data of additional instruments. And decorator `@sec_context` is syntactic sugar, because every time
Indie compiler sees a function definition decorated with `@sec_context` it transforms it into a class, inherited from
`indie.SecContext` according to a few simple rules:

- function definition decorated with `@sec_context` is replaced with a class with the same name inherited from
  `indie.SecContext` base class;
- the body of the function becomes a `calc()` method of the generated class;
- generated class may optionally have `__init__` constructor (only if it is needed).

Let us see how it works with an example, this piece of code:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import sec_context

@sec_context
def SecHighLow(self):
    return self.high[0], self.low[0]
```

transforms into this:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import SecContext

class SecHighLow(SecContext):
    def calc(self):
        return self.high[0], self.low[0]
```

The code that actually uses the `SecHighLow` looks like this:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator, tf

# >>> definition of SecHighLow is here <<<

@indicator('MyIndie')
class Main(MainContext):
    def __init__(self):
        self._h, self._l = self.calc_on(SecHighLow, time_frame=tf('1D'))

    def calc(self):
        return self._h[0], self._l[0]
```

NOTE that in the Indie (since version 4) it is allowed to call `Context.calc_on` only from `__init__` constructors.
