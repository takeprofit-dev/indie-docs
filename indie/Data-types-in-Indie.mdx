This section is an overview of core data types of the Indie language.

# Basic data types

They are:

- `float` — type of double precision (64-bit) floating point numbers
- `int` — integer numbers
- `bool` — boolean values `True` or `False`
- `str` — string data type

# `indie.Optional[T]` class

In Indie (unlike in Python) it is not allowed to assign `None` value to a variable of any arbitrary type (e.g. basic
data types). But it is allowed to do so with the help of `indie.Optional[T]` class.

`indie.Optional[T]` is similar to Python's `typing.Optional[T]` with a few significant differences:

- `None` can be assigned to values which have `indie.Optional[T]` type only. `None` cannot be assigned to values of some
  `T` type which is not an optional type
- to write some value to an optional variable just simple assignment operator should be used
- to access `T` value which is stored in `indie.Optional[T]` it is required to explicitly call `value()` or `value_or()` method
- if `value()` method is called on an optional variable which is `None` it raises runtime error
- to test if optional variable has some value stored inside `is None` and `is not None` constructs should be used
- if variable was declared as `indie.Optional[T]` then `T` cannot be changed for that variable to some other type `U`

For example this will not work in Indie:

```py
a = None  # compilation error
# ...
a = 42
```

Indie compiler cannot infer `T` type for `a` in this example. Yes, it may guess that `a` is of `indie.Optional` type,
but it is unclear how to guess that `T` will be an `int` for it.

This will not work too:

```py
a: int = None  # compilation error
# ...
a = 42
```

In this case, well, it is explicitly declared that `a` is not an optional type, so `None` cannot be assigned to it.

That is why type of `a` must be declared explicitly as an optional type:

```py
a: indie.Optional[int] = None
a = 42
# ...
a = 'foobar'  # compilation error
```

Once variable `a` was declared as optional of `int` value, it cannot at some point start to store `str` values.

By the way if you do not assign any value to an optional variable it will be `None` too:

```py
a: indie.Optional[int] = None
b: indie.Optional[int]
```

Both `a ` and `b` in this example are `None`.

To check if optional variable `a` is `None` or not we use:

```py
if a is None:
    # ...
if a is not None:
    # ...
```

To access value stored in optional variable `a`, the `value()` method should be explicitly called:

```py
if a is not None:
    b = a.value()
```

If an optional variable has no value stored inside then `value()` method call raises a runtime error. For example:

```py
s: indie.Optional[str]
t = s.value()  # runtime error, because `s is None == True`
```

But this works fine:

```py
s: indie.Optional[str] = 'foobar'
t = s.value()
```

because in this case string `'foobar'` is stored in optional variable `s`.

# Built-in container types

At the moment (Indie v4) only `list[T]` is implemented in the Indie language. There are partial support of a `tuple[T]`.
It is planned to add support for `dict[K, V]` and `set[T]` in the near future.

# Series data types

- `indie.Series[T]` and an alias `indie.SeriesF` for `indie.Series[float]`
- `indie.MutSeries[T]` and an alias `indie.MutSeriesF` for `indie.MutSeries[float]`

`Series[T]` is a read-only container which stores series of `T` values. `MutSeries[T]` extends `Series[T]` with only
`__setitem__` method, which allows writing to the last element of the container (which syntactically looks like
`some_mut_series[0] = some_value`).

Type `T` can be (almost) any type in Indie, not just `float`, but also `int`, `bool`, `str`, etc.

# Context data types

There are three context classes:

- `indie.Context` is a base class that represents a context of a chart instrument
- `indie.MainContext` is a class that represents main context, extends `indie.Context`
- `indie.SecContext` is a class that represents secondary context, extends `indie.Context`

# Algorithm base class

There is a `indie.Algorithm` base class. All algorithms from `indie.algorithms` package are inherited from it.
