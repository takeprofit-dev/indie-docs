title: Request additional instruments

An indicator written in Indie is executed after it is added to a candle chart. The symbol and time frame of the
instrument of that chart is the main indicator instrument which is bound to the `Main` context of the indicator. It is
possible to request additional instrument data in indicator. For that purpose there are `@sec_context` decorator and
`indie.SecContext` class in combination with `Context.calc_on()` function.

# `@sec_context()` and `Context.calc_on()`

Decorator `@sec_context` is a syntactic sugar that can be applied to a function definition which is an equivalent of
writing a class inherited from `indie.SecContext` (more about the mechanics how this works can be found
[here](https://dev.test.tpinf.in/docs/indie/How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#functions-decorated-with-sec_context)). The
body of such a decorated function becomes an entry point for calculation when a data update is occurred on the
corresponding additional instrument. Function call of `Context.calc_on` creates a connection between the `Main` context
and the secondary one.

Here is an example of an indicator that requests one additional instrument:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator, MainContext, sec_context, param

@sec_context
def SecMain(self):
    return self.high[0], self.low[0]

@indicator('Minimal calc_on example', overlay_main_pane=True)
@param.time_frame('sec_time_frame', default='1D')
class Main(MainContext):
    def __init__(self, sec_time_frame):
        self._sec_high, self._sec_low = self.calc_on(SecMain, time_frame=sec_time_frame)

    def calc(self):
        return self._sec_high[0], self._sec_low[0]
```

NOTE: It is required that `Context.calc_on` function is called from `__init__` constructor method of a main or secondary
context.

If this indicator is added on a AAPL 15m chart it will draw two blue lines showing daily prices of the AAPL symbol.
There are two instrument contexts in this indicator:

- main context `Main` which is executed every time a data update on the main instrument AAPL 15m happens and
- secondary context `SecMain` which is executed every time a data update on the secondary instrument AAPL 1D happens.

Function [`Context.calc_on`](Library-reference#func_Context_calc_on) has more parameters besides `sec_context` and `time_frame`. Here is its signature:

```txt
Context.calc_on(
    sec_context: typing.Type[indie.SecContext],
    exchange: indie.Optional[str] = None,
    ticker: indie.Optional[str] = None,
    time_frame: indie.Optional[indie.TimeFrame] = None,
    lookahead: bool = False
) -> indie.SeriesF | tuple[indie.SeriesF, ...]
```

If `exchange`, `ticker` and `time_frame` are not given, then the corresponding values are taken from the current
instrument.
