Due to the real-time nature of a candle chart, most of tech analysis indicators work according to principles of a
_sliding window_ technique. Indie has `@algorithm` decorator and `SeriesF`, `MutSeriesF` data types which help to create
algorithms that use this technique. All this provides an effective and convenient way for _series processing_.

# `@algorithm`, `SeriesF` and `MutSeriesF`

Decorator [`@algorithm`](Library-reference#decor_algorithm) is a syntactic sugar that can be applied to a function
definition which is equivalent to writing a class definition of an algorithm inherited from `indie.Algorithm` class.
More details about how this kind of syntactic sugar works are [here](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works).

[`SeriesF`](Library-reference#class_SeriesF) is a data type that represents series of numeric values like prices of
some instrument. Every element of a `SeriesF` object stores a value at time of some bar on a chart. `SeriesF` objects
have an interface which gives access to their values with square brackets operator. For example, series of close prices
of some instrument is `self.close` (where `self` is an object with `Context` interface) and current (the last) close
price can be accessed with expression `self.close[0]`. The close price at the previous candle is `self.close[1]` and so
on.

Series objects like `self.open`, `self.high`, `self.low`, `self.close` and `self.volume` are built-in and read-only. But
Indie lets you create your own series objects, put some values that your algorithm calculates into them and use them in
the further parts of your indicator code. This is exactly what `MutSeriesF` type is intended to be used for.

Function [`MutSeriesF.new`](Library-reference#func_MutSeriesF_new) wraps any primitive number value and returns
an object of `MutSeriesF` type with that value written into the `[0]` (the most recent element). This provides access to
previous values of that value in the future Indie invocations. In other words, `MutSeriesF` data type is what you need
if you want to persist some value over bars.

NOTE: `MutSeriesF` is a type alias for `MutSeries[float]` and `SeriesF` is a type alias for `Series[float]`. In future
versions of Indie it is planned to support other types for element of those containers besides `float`.

# SMA, Sum and sliding window technique

Now it is a good time to look at some of the algorithms in action. Let us take some very basic indicator like for
example _Simple moving average_ (SMA) and see how it works under the hood. To calculate SMA with length=4 of some price
series, we have to divide every element of a corresponding _sum_ (with the same length=4) by it's length. That is why,
first we have to look in detail how sum algorithm could be implemented.

The sum of length=4 could be calculated very simple. First, the value of `sum_0` (where `0` is the bar index) is
undefined, because at that point there is only one price is available in the input series. Same with the `sum_1` and
`sum_2`. But the value of `sum_3` equals to `price_0 + price_1 + price_2 + price_3` which is `5 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10`.
So far so good and the next sum value, `sum_4`, equals to `price_1 + price_2 + price_3 + price_4` which is
`2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 9` correspondingly. Finally, in the same manner we calculate `sum_5` as
`price_2 + price_3 + price_4 + price_5` which is `1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13`. And so on, this is illustrated on the diagram:

Calculation of a sum in a straightforward (but non-effective by time) way:

```txt
ctx.bar_index:      0,    1,    2,    3,    4,    5, ...
price:              5,    2,    1,    2,    4,    6, ...
                    _,  ...
                    _,    _,  ...
                    _,    _,    _,   ...
                    _,    _,    _,    10, ...
                    _,    _,    _,    10,   9,  ...
sum(length=4):      _,    _,    _,    10,   9,   13, ...
```

Here is Indie implementation of this algorithm:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import algorithm, SeriesF, MutSeriesF

@algorithm
def Sum(self, price: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
    result = 0.0
    for i in range(length):
        result += price[i]
    return MutSeriesF.new(result)
```

Reader may notice that we have to sum the same price values more than once. We may calculate the next sum values more
efficiently using the sum value calculated on a previous step. For example `sum_4 = sum_3 - price_0 + price_4`,
`sum_5 = sum_4 - price_1 + price_5` and so on. This other way of calculation is exactly the mentioned before
_sliding window_ technique. It turns out that with larger lengths the second way is way more efficient in terms of time.
And here is the Indie implementation of it:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from math import nan
from indie import algorithm, SeriesF, MutSeriesF

@algorithm
def Sum(self, price: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
    s = MutSeriesF.new(init=0)
    s[0] += price[0]
    result: float
    if len(price) > length:
        s[0] -= price[length]
        result = s[0]
    else:
        result = nan
    return MutSeriesF.new(result)
```

NOTE: If you need a [Sum](Library-reference#class_alg_Sum) or [SMA](Library-reference#class_alg_Sma) you don't
have to implement them by yourself. Simply import them from the standard library like this:
`from indie.algorithms import Sum, Sma`.

Now, after we have a `Sum` algorithm, it is trivial to write SMA as `Sma` algorithm too:

```py
@algorithm
def Sma(self, price: SeriesF, length: int) -> SeriesF:
    s = Sum.new(price, length)
    return MutSeriesF.new(s[0] / length)
```

As you can see, it is very easy to call one algorithm from another. It is very natural to connect them in a sort of a
chain. That is why all the functions decorated with `@algorithm` return `SeriesF` result (or tuple of `SeriesF` values).

Finally here is the `Main` entry point of our indicator that plots it on chart:

```py
@indicator('SMA Example', overlay_main_pane=True)
def Main(self):
    result = Sma.new(self.close, 12)
    return result[0]
```

# Series behavior during history vs runtime

Suppose we have an indicator that counts green bars of an instrument on a chart:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator, MutSeriesF

@indicator('Green bars counter')
def Main(self):
    green_count = MutSeriesF.new(init=0)
    if self.close[0] > self.open[0]:
        green_count[0] += 1
    return green_count[0]
```

![Figure 6.1. Indicator which counts green bars on a chart.](/images/indie/Algorithms-for-series-processing/figure-1.png)

Bar coloring traditionally works this way: if closing price of a bar is greater than it's opening price, then the bar is
green, otherwise it is red. In the Indie code we have a series `green_count` object which accumulates the desired count.
This count is returned from `Main` which plots a blue line on a chart. On Figure 6.1 we see how blue line raises up by 1
on every green bar and stays flat if bar is red. First let us take a close look at how this Series object behaves during
indicator calculation on a historical bars of some imaginary instrument. Close and open prices of our instrument could
be for example:

```txt
time:      t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5
open:       9, 18,  8,  7,  8, 15
close:     12,  7, 14, 13, 12,  5
```

History prices `open` and `close` will be passed to the indicator for calculation one by one from left to right.
Indicator will calculate, at time `t0`, like this '12 is greater than 9, so we add 1 to green_count'. On the next
calculation, at time `t1`, it will be '7 is not greater than 18, so do nothing. Value of green_count is still 1'. In the
end, `green_count` series will contain these values:

```txt
time:          t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5
green_count:    1,  1,  2,  3,  4,  4
```

Thus, during the calculation of indicator on historical data everything is simple, predictable and very natural.

Let us suppose that starting from time `t6` the realtime begins:

```txt
time:          t6, t6, t6, t7, t7, t7, t7, t8, t8, t9, ...
open:           6,  6,  6, 11, 11, 11, 11,  7,  7, ...
close:         10,  2, 12, 14, 12, 16,  9,  5, 12, ...
```

Our indicator will behave like this:

```txt
time:              t6, t6, t6, t7, t7, t7, t7, t8, t8, t9, ...
green_count:        5,  4,  5,  6,  6,  6,  5,  5,  6, ...
last bar update:            ^               ^       ^
```

Moments of the final bar update are marked with `^`s. They are important, because values calculated in these moments are
stored in the end in the `green_count` series, overwriting all values written there before at the time of the same bar.

Bar usually updates multiple times at realtime. Every realtime update of a bar triggers a calculation of indicator.
Right before every such calculation the state of the `green_count[0]` series element resets to it's previous value (i.e.
`green_count[1]`) â€” the value it had at the time of previous bar. That is why during the three updates of bar starting
at `t6`, corresponding element of `green_count` series was set to 5 at first, then reverted back to 4, then finalized at
value 5.

If nothing is written in the `green_count[0]` series element and bar finalizes then this value is carried further to
the next series element without change.

# `MutSeriesF.new()` function description

```py
MutSeriesF.new(
  reset: indie.Optional[float] = None,
  init: indie.Optional[float] = None,
  size: indie.Optional[int] = None,
) -> indie.MutSeriesF
```

Function `MutSeriesF.new` creates `MutSeriesF` objects which are containers for calculated values in Indie code. The
main feature of `MutSeriesF` container is ability to store (or 'remember') historical values of some variable, those
values could be later accessed with the square brackets operator. At the moment `MutSeriesF` class supports only
`float` type as series element.

Please note that `MutSeriesF` objects give read-write access only to the last value of the series object and read access
to any (well, down to some limit) previous values.

Parameters:

- `reset` â€” is a value that is written into the most recent element of the `MutSeriesF` every time `MutSeriesF.new()`
  function is executed. The effect of this parameter is the same as:

```py
# this:
s = MutSeriesF.new(reset_val)

# is the same as:
s = MutSeriesF.new()
s[0] = reset_val
```

- `init` â€” is a value that is written into the most recent element of the series object only once after the `MutSeriesF`
  object was created. Or, in other words, it is a value that is written only at the time of the first `MutSeriesF.new()`
  function call.

```py
# this:
s = MutSeriesF.new(init=init_val)

# is similar to:
s = MutSeriesF.new()
if self.bar_index == 0:
    s[0] = init_val
```

- `size` â€” is number of elements that `MutSeriesF` object should persist in memory. The default and minimum possible
  size is 2, which means that a series of size=2 stores in memory one value at the time of the last candle and another
  at the time of the previous candle. The size is automatically expanded during the historical calculation of an
  indicator. For example:

```py
# This series allows us to get access to s[0], s[1] and s[2] elements from now
s = MutSeriesF.new(0.0, size=3)

# We can read previous value which is out of size=3, for example s[5]:
s[0] = s[5] + 1
```

The size of `s` was expanded from 3 to 6. It is allowed to get access to s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3] and s[4], s[5] elements
after that. It may seem to have not very much sense at first. We set some size, but we are allowed to expand it later.
Well, it is allowed to expand the size only during the calculation of indicator history. The algorithm by some reason
may calculate the lookback offset for some series at runtime, depending on prices for example like this:

```py
max_size = 100
offset = min(math.round(self.close[0]), max_size)
s = MutSeriesF.new(init=0.0, size=max_size)
a = s[offset]  # calc something with it...
```

We cannot predict values of `self.close` series. They could be less than `max_size = 100` at first but then during
realtime, they could rise higher. That is why we should always limit the max_offset with `min` and reserve the `s`'s
size with `size` parameter. Otherwise the indicator would fail, since, again, we cannot expand the size at realtime.

NOTE: `MutSeriesF` objects also have a method `request_size(new_size: int)` which can be used to expand the size
explicitly.

`MutSeriesF.new` function has a 'get or create' semantics. It means that only one `MutSeriesF` object is created per one
`MutSeriesF.new` function call occurrence in the code. All subsequent calls of `MutSeriesF.new` in exactly the same
position in Indie script simply return `MutSeriesF` objects created previously. For example:

```py
@indicator('Example')
def Main(self):
    s1 = MutSeriesF.new(0.0)
    s2 = MutSeriesF.new(42.0)
    # ...
```

In this code only two `MutSeriesF` objects are created: `s1` and `s2`. The `Main` function is called multiple times -
per every historical candle and per every realtime update of the last candle â€” thus multiple times `MutSeries.new`
functions are called too. But only when `self.bar_index == 0` the `s1` and `s2` objects are created. During all the
subsequent calls, `s1` and `s2` only receive references to existing `MutSeriesF` objects. If you want more details about how `MutSeriesF.new` function works, read [this](https://dev.test.tpinf.in/docs/indie/How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#mutseriesfnew-method).

# TL;DR: How to use classes from `indie.algorithms` package in my indicator?

Suppose we have found an algorithm (e.g. [RSI](Library-reference#class_alg_Rsi)) in the Indie library and want to use
it in our indicator. These are the steps which should be done in order to achive this:

- Import the class of the desired algorithm, which in our example let it be the `indie.algorithms.Rsi`:

```py
from indie.algorithms import Rsi
```

- Go to the place in the code where you want to call the algorithm. Algorithms can be called either:

  - from [`Main`](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#main-entry-point) entry point or
  - from [secondary context](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#functions-decorated-with-sec_context) entry point or
  - from some other [algorithm](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#functions-decorated-with-algorithm).

  In our example we go to the `Main` entry point function:

```py
@indicator('Test')
def Main(self):
    # ...
    # >>> somewhere here <<<
    # ...
```

NOTE: that you cannot call algorithm's `new()` function from global scope of indicator or from some 'plain old python
function'.

- Call the algorithm's `new()` _syntactic sugar_ function according to it's signature which for `Rsi` is
  `new(src: indie.SeriesF, length: int) -> indie.SeriesF` (here is the
  [link](Library-reference#func_alg_Rsi_new)) and write the resulting series of RSI values to some variable,
  e.g. `rsi_result`:

```py
@indicator('Test')
def Main(self):
    rsi_result = Rsi.new(self.close, 12)
    # ...
```

- From now you may use the `rsi_result` series, for example, return it from `Main` for plotting on chart or pass to some other algorithm for further processing. If you want just access the last `float` RSI value, use square brackets operator `rsi_result[0]`.

Final version of our example looks like this:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator
from indie.algorithms import Rsi

@indicator('Example')
def Main(self):
    rsi_result = Rsi.new(self.close, 12)
    return rsi_result[0]
```

# TL;DR: How to use `indie.MutSeriesF` in my indicator?

Suppose we are working on an indicator where we calculate some math formula on every candle. Let us take something simple like `OC2 = (OpenPrice + ClosePrice) / 2` as an example of such a formula. Here is Indie code that calculates and plots `OC2`:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator

@indicator('Example', overlay_main_pane=True)
def Main(self):
    OC2 = (self.open[0] + self.close[0]) / 2
    return OC2
```

NOTE: That type of `OC2` variable is `float`.

It could be very useful to store such a value like `OC2` (or, to be more accurate, a _series of values_ because we
calculate new value on each candle) in a Series-like container (which is `indie.MutSeriesF`). This gives following
benefits:

- it will be possible to access historical values of `OC2` (values which were calculated previously on historical
  candles);
- it will be possible to process series of `OC2` values with algorithms from `indie.algorithms` package (or our own).

Here is how to do it:

- Import class `indie.MutSeriesF` to your indicator:

```py
from indie import MutSeriesF
```

- Wrap the value with `indie.MutSeriesF.new()` _syntactic sugar_ static method:

```py
OC2 = MutSeriesF.new((self.open[0] + self.close[0]) / 2)
```

Since this moment, type of `OC2` variable is `indie.MutSeriesF`, which is a container with `float` values inside.
Please note, that `indie.MutSeriesF.new()` method can be called either:

- from [`Main`](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#main-entry-point) entry point or
- from [secondary context](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#functions-decorated-with-sec_context) entry point or
- from some [algorithm](How-Indies-syntactic-sugar-works#functions-decorated-with-algorithm).

NOTE: that you cannot call `indie.MutSeriesF.new()` function from global scope of indicator or from some 'plain old
python function'.

- Use the `OC2` series in further calculations:
  - access historical values of `OC2` variable with the square brackets operator. For example:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator, MutSeriesF

@indicator('Example', overlay_main_pane=True)
def Main(self):
    OC2 = MutSeriesF.new((self.open[0] + self.close[0]) / 2)
    return OC2[0], OC2[1], OC2[2]
```

Here `OC2[0]` returns `float` value of our variable on the last candle, `OC2[1]` - value on the previous candle,
`OC2[2]` - value that was 2 candles back and so on.

- process series of `OC2` values with some algorithm, for example SMA, like this:

```py
# indie:lang_version = 4
from indie import indicator, MutSeriesF
from indie.algorithms import Sma

@indicator('Example', overlay_main_pane=True)
def Main(self):
    OC2 = MutSeriesF.new((self.open[0] + self.close[0]) / 2)
    smoothed_OC2 = Sma.new(OC2, 12)
    return smoothed_OC2[0]
```
